# PLANK host configuration

The host reads `/etc/plank/host.conf`. It uses INI-style
section headings and globally scoped `key = value` entries. Section names are
organizational only. Blank lines and text following `#` are ignored.

This document is the complete accepted runtime key set. A setting absent from
this document is intentionally rejected, including inherited Sunshine options
for unsupported platforms, encoders, display control, update notifications,
consumer NAT discovery, and product behaviors fixed by PLANK.

## General

### host_name

Host name returned during PLANK negotiation and used for mDNS service
advertisement. Default: the operating-system hostname.

### min_log_level

Minimum logged severity. Accepted values: `verbose`, `debug`, `info`,
`warning`, `error`, `fatal`, `none`, or the corresponding integer `0` through
`6`. Default: `info`.

## Network

### port

Base port used by PLANK HTTPS authentication and native QUIC. Default:
`28989`. Changing it requires matching firewall policy and client reachability.

### mdns_discovery

Publish the host through mDNS/Avahi for automatic client discovery. Accepted
values: `true` or `false`. Default: `false`. This controls advertisement only;
manually configured hostname/IP bookmarks continue to work while disabled.

### ping_timeout

Milliseconds allowed for initial media-channel pings and established-client
inactivity before the host cleans up the stream. Default: `10000`.

## NDI screen output (Windows)

Optional. Publishes the host's screens as NDI sources on the LAN so they can be
picked up in Evercast's desktop app (Stream, then Stream NDI) or any other NDI
receiver. Sources are published whether or not a PLANK client is connected.
Requires the free NDI runtime (install NDI Tools from ndi.video); PLANK does not
ship it. There is no audio in this version. Restart the PLANK service after
changing these options.

### ndi_output

Publish NDI sources. Accepted values: `on` or `off`. Default: `off`. If the NDI
runtime is not installed the host logs one line and carries on normally.

### ndi_outputs

Which displays to publish: `primary` or `all`. Default: `primary`.

### ndi_source_name

Name of the NDI source. Default: `<COMPUTERNAME> - Screen N`. A custom name is
used as is for one display; with `ndi_outputs = all` and several displays a
number is appended. NDI receivers also show the machine name in front.

### ndi_fps

Frames per second sent to NDI, 1 to 60. Default: `30`. Higher values cost more
CPU and network bandwidth.

## Security and state

### allow_root_login

Allow PAM authentication as root. Default: `false`. Enabling this does not
bypass PAM/SSSD/HBAC policy or active-desktop ownership checks.

### pkey

Path to the host TLS private key. The packaged profile uses
`/etc/plank/tls/key.pem`.

### cert

Path to the host TLS certificate. The packaged profile uses
`/etc/plank/tls/cert.pem`.

### file_state

Path to mutable workstation identity state. The packaged profile uses
`/var/lib/plank/plank-state.json`.

### log_path

Path to the persistent host log. The packaged profile uses
`/var/log/plank/host.log`.

## Audio

### audio_sink

Optional PipeWire/Pulse-compatible host sink name to capture. Empty selects the
operating system's current output sink.

## Input

### keybindings

Optional comma-separated client-keycode/host-keycode replacement pairs. The
default PLANK modifier mappings remain in effect when omitted.

### key_repeat_delay

Milliseconds before a held remote key begins repeating. Default: `500`.

### key_repeat_frequency

Remote key-repeat events per second. Default: approximately `24.9`.

Keyboard, mouse, high-resolution scrolling, and native scancodes are mandatory
PLANK behaviors and are not configurable.

## Display

### startup_layout

Display policy applied before the display manager starts. `physical` preserves
connected displays. `virtual` prepares one internal 1920x1080 login output;
the authenticated bookmark then supplies the active virtual layout. Default:
`physical`.

### adapter_name

Optional GPU/display adapter selector for multi-GPU hosts. Empty uses automatic
selection.

## Common video behavior

### minimum_fps_target

Minimum capture cadence used when the desktop is static. Valid range: `0`
through `1000`. `0` derives the target from half the requested stream rate.

### min_threads

Minimum software-encoder thread/slice count. The packaged PLANK
profile uses `16`.

## NVIDIA NVENC

These settings tune both the qualified direct NVENC path and the retained
NVIDIA compatibility encoder where applicable. They do not select a codec or
backend; the bookmark's encoding profile does that.

### nvenc_preset

NVENC quality preset number from `1` through `7`. Default: `1`.

### nvenc_twopass

NVENC multipass mode: `disabled`, `quarter_res`, or `full_res`. Default:
`quarter_res`.

### nvenc_spatial_aq

Enable spatial adaptive quantization. Accepted values: `true` or `false`.
Default: `false`.

### nvenc_vbv_increase

Percentage added to the NVENC VBV buffer size. Valid range: `0` through `400`.
Default: `0`.

### nvenc_split_encode

Split-frame encoding policy: `disabled`, `driver_decides`, or `enabled`.
Default: `driver_decides`.

### nvenc_h264_cavlc

Use CAVLC rather than CABAC for H.264 when supported. Accepted values: `true`
or `false`. Default: `false`.

## x264 software encoder

### sw_preset

x264 speed/quality preset. The packaged PLANK profile uses
`ultrafast`.

### sw_tune

x264 tuning policy. The packaged PLANK profile uses `zerolatency`.

### sw_vbv_maxrate_percentage

Peak x264 rate as a percentage of the bookmark/session encoder target. Valid
range: `100` through `400`; the packaged value is `150`.

### sw_vbv_buffer_frames

VBV reservoir expressed in average-rate frame units. Valid range: `0` through
`16`; the packaged value is `4`.

### sw_scenecut

x264 scene-change threshold. Valid range: `0` through `100`; `0` disables
adaptive scene-change keyframes. The packaged value is `40`.
